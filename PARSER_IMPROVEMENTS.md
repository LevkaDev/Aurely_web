# ✅ Parser Improvements - Text Cleaning

## What Was Improved

### 1. Expanded Service Phrases Removal

Added many more patterns to remove service words:

**Reminder creation phrases:**
- "set/create/make/add/schedule/put a reminder"
- "remind me to/for/about"

**Politeness:**
- "please", "thanks", "thank you"

**Modal verbs and intentions:**
- "I need to", "have to", "got to", "gotta"
- "must", "should", "ought to"
- "want to", "would like to"
- "don't forget to", "remember to"
- "make sure to/I"

**Time-related service words:**
- "at/on/in/for/by the time/date/day"

**Articles and prepositions:**
- Leading "to", "a", "an", "the"
- Leading "I"
- Standalone prepositions at start

### 2. Better Text Cleanup

- Remove leading/trailing punctuation (,. !?)
- Remove standalone prepositions at start
- Better whitespace handling
- Preserve important content

### 3. Restored Fallback Logic

If no time expression found, defaults to ASAP (5 minutes) instead of returning null.
