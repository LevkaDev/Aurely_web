# ðŸ“± Save App Icon Here

## You attached the app icon image (blue microphone with bell)

Please save it as: `website/images/app-icon.png`

### Quick Steps:

1. Find the icon image you attached (blue microphone with bell on light background)
2. Save it as `app-icon.png` 
3. Put it in the `website/images/` folder

### Or if you have the icon elsewhere:

Tell me the path to the icon file, and I'll copy it to the right location!

Example:
- "The icon is at ~/Downloads/icon.png"
- "It's in /Users/levan/Desktop/Aurely-Icon.png"

Once saved, the website will automatically use it in the navigation and footer.
